Rebuilding the FRC Dashboard Project
After you customize the FRC Dashboard Project, you must rebuild the project so that the Driver Station launches the most recent version of the project.

Complete the following steps to rebuild the project and specify which project the Driver Station launches automatically.

In the Project Explorer window of the Dashboard Project, expand the list of Build Specifications to reveal the FRC_Dashboard application.
Right-click FRC_Dashboard and select Properties from the shortcut menu. If the Application Builder Information dialog box appears, click OK.
Verify that the Target filename is Dashboard.exe. The Driver Station reads this executable file as the file to launch.
Verify that the Destination directory is where you want to save the file. Click Build to build the new project.
Explore to where you saved the new executable file. Copy the new Dashboard.exe file to the FRC Dashboard folder within Program Files.  You may want to save a backup of the original Dashboard.exe that installed in that folder.
